"1798" "One example would be that we chose to locate a data center up at The Dalles in Oregon for lots of reasons. One reason was that the bulk of the power there comes from relatively clean sources.

Where was he a week ago when it was clear that the two chambers were on a collision course? He needed to be publicly and aggressively involved in pushing the debate from the start, but instead, he took a laissez-faire attitude toward the legislature's handling of the budget. Tweeting \"Hopeful that the GA will pass a compromise that protects priorities like education while creating jobs & expanding opportunity\" two hours and 13 minutes before the legislature is set to adjourn doesn't cut it."

Mitt Romney has pledged to \"get rid\" of Planned Parenthood. A number of states have passed abusive laws to discourage legal abortions or to harass women who obtain them. Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich have accused the Obama administration of interfering with religious liberty by insisting that insurance plans cover contraception. And that doesn't even begin to plumb the depths of Rush Limbaugh."

But it's more than just the fastball; if Wainwright can have sharper command of his secondary pitches, it would make his fastball more effective. The famous Wainwright curve has been all over the place; he's thrown it in the zone only 30 percent of the time. (But on a positive note, he is getting hitters to chase it.)

Mr. Werdesheim claimed that the boy then came at him with a nail-studded two-by-four and swung the board toward his head, at which point he deflected the blow and knocked Mr. Ausby to the ground.

High, and, when one of them indicated a desire to attend St. Louis University, he sent him there. Last Fall, he travelled with me 350 miles to see my granddaughter (whom he definitely considers his as well as mine) make her first Reconciliation. We both had to go through an agonizing application for annulments (yes, he had to do this also even though he is not Catholic). My undying admiration for his submitting himself to this ranks right up there with educating my children and raising them and being by my side every Sunday at Mass."

"2441" "øDrawing from actual events in Van Gogh's life, Laurence Anholt's book weaves a story about how a little boy named Camille befriends the artist. Camille and his family appeared in paintings created by Van Gogh. This interactive story reveals how, although Van Gogh painted vibrant paintings of the village people and its surroundings, the townspeople of Camille's village thought the painter was odd and ostracized him. But Camille and his family accepted Van Gogh and saw the genius of his work. The book contains 19 puzzles which kids play to bring the characters within the book to life. By tapping illustrations of characters, kids can activate a mode that lets them see the gears and mechanisms that would make the character move. By tapping again on the character, the mechanisms spring apart so that kids can connect them once again. When they do, the character will now appear to animate in the story. Kids can also use simple art tools to repaint the characters so that they appear on the pages how they would like them to look. With soothing background music and the ability to be transported to a museum for closer inspection of Van Gogh's work, this is a great way for kids to learn about this artist and 10 of his famous paintings."

The program paid more in benefits last year than it collected in taxes, and that gap will grow over time. More importantly, by 2037, Social Security won't have enough money to pay its promised benefits, which means today's 50-year-olds are looking at a 25 percent benefit cut in their mid-70s."

That time, the al dente pasta ($13.95) was topped with a delicious pork/fennel sausage ragout and accompanied by a vinaigrette-dressed mesclun salad.

And better yet, that same team is also lacking picks in the third and sixth rounds because of trades with the Jets and Packers. The Saints have only their first-round pick, two fourths and a seventh. Not good for a team that could really use extra picks to continue to build around their core of players."

Baltimore will naturally be the first place to cut. Cut jobs. Cut services. Cut power supplies.

"2547" "The show also shared some of the shortcomings of horror movies. Odd Future's emphasis on nonstop outrage can feel monotonous; the umpteenth exhortation to kill people and burn stuff doesn't have anywhere near the same power to shock that the first one does. The show started off so frenetic -- Hodgy Beats pitched himself into the crowd during a performance of Mellowhype's hit \"64,\" losing his microphone in the process -- that the pace was difficult to sustain. This would bode ill for Odd Future's career if there was nothing to the act but shock value. Yet even as they're driving the censors batty, the group is artful: the productions, mostly by Tyler and Left Brain, are musically adventurous and sometimes gorgeous in their cobwebby creepiness. A mosh pit at the Wellmont is probably not the best place to access the subtlety of Tyler's music.

From parking spots above a bluff, a staircase leads down to a cove-shaped stretch of sand that is Bells Beach, the most legendary surf spot on the continent. It's celebrated as the birthplace of professional surfing, at least in Australia. Bells claims to have the world's oldest continuous pro surfing contest, going back to 1961. Part of the appeal, and the challenge, of Bells is that it's the flip side of the Gold Coast. Getting there and staying there is a chore. But it's one that feels more special than the Gold Coast (for Southern Californians, it's like the difference between Huntington Beach and Trestles). The down side is that you can make the trip all the way out to Bells and hit a day when the surf isn't up to par and the contest is off. It's a long way back to the city.

"2754" "Outlook: Team officials have been consistent in saying that they need to add another wide receiver. With the free agent market lacking of any good options unless the Ravens want to deal with the baggage that Plaxico Burress and Braylon Edwards bring, the draft may be their last opportunity. Hill, who never had a chance to shine in Georgia’s Tech’s run-oriented offense, has wowed teams with his performance in workouts. He’s 6-foot-4 and 215 pounds, and he ran a 4.31 40 at the NFL Scouting Combine. If he’s still available and there’s no certainty of that, he could make the Ravens think long and hard about selecting an offensive lineman at pick 29. The Ravens, however, could just as easily wait and try to grab a guy like Sanu, Jenkins or Quick in the second or third round. While the position seems to be an annual question mark, the Ravens are extremely excited about Smith’s rookie season and they still have high hopes for second-year receivers, Tandon Doss and LaQuan Williams. But the reality is they are still missing another young outside option who can hold his own physically and stretch the defense with his speed. If they see that guy available in the draft, they won’t hesitate to select him regardless of the round."

The Englishman is playing this week in the Wells Fargo Championship for the fourth time and has yet to perform at his best on the course at Quail Hollow.

He has not broken 70 in any of his 10 rounds on the course in Charlotte. Because of his U.S. commitments, he did not defend his title in the Ballantine's Championship last week in South Korea. ... While Westwood wants a title in the Masters and the Green Jacket that goes with it more than anything, he has had more than his share of titles in some of those other Masters tournaments. His second consecutive title in the Indonesian Masters was his 11th victory, among his career total of 37, in which the tournaments has the word Masters in the title.

"4661" "Most driveway experts will back you up on at least one point – that sealing every year is excessive. Even many sealing professionals and seal-coat manufacturers agree on that point. Sealing every year can actually lead to problems, including seal-coat peeling and cracking. However, letting your driveway go unsealed for five years might also be excessive, especially if it has turned gray and is developing small cracks. There is some controversy about how often an asphalt (blacktop) driveway should be sealed, but every three years appears to strike a good balance. When an asphalt driveway turns gray, it indicates oxidation of the asphalt and weathering by sun, rain and freezing. A coat of sealer should be helpful. The small cracks are another sign that the asphalt is having problems. If the cracks are larger than hairline, fill them with top-quality crack filler before sealing. Picking good crack fillers can also be difficult. In general, avoid cheap products – they won't last more than a year or so. Most dealers sell professional-grade fillers that cost more, but will usually last a lot longer. Very tiny (hairline) cracks can be filled by the sealer; many sealers contain sand-like filler material that will close them. Before sealing, clean the driveway as thoroughly as possible. Use a blower or scraper to remove all debris and dirt. Finally, whether you seal the driveway or hire a pro, make sure a top-quality sealer is used."

"6706" "Hey, Tony: Read your article about kickers becoming \"too good.\" I'd like to get your opinion on the following rule change which would take effect when I become king: On kickoffs, if the ball is kicked out-of-bounds on the fly, penalty places the ball on the 40, as presently. If it bounces or rolls out-of-bounds before getting to the end zone, the receiving team takes possession at that yard line, just like a punt. I think the change would add an interesting element to the game, requiring more precision than distance kicking, and may cause receiving teams to use two returners to cover the field, reducing the number of blockers by one, or risk bad field position. BTW, I happen to enjoy watching teams (not QB'd by Elway) try to succeed in 90-yard drives. -- Seren Hrachian, Athens, N.Y."
