Hess refused to answer why he tossed two fans from the game. That's just another example of the officials flexing their muscle, but with no accountability. We're not asking that all officials — the majority of whom do an excellent job under tough circumstances — explain every decision, but there needs to be a system put into place where questions can be asked or things explained.

Officials — like coaches and players — should enter the realm of having a forum answer tough questions when the situations call for it."

I'm sure we'll talk about that when we get to talk about funding measures. There are school districts that are partly in Portland and partly not. The Centennial School District, for instance.

In lieu of a gift I asked the woman to come over and \"shop\" at my house. I wanted to help cut their expenses so the money they do have can be used for other things. Since I have every thing from cleaning supplies to personal hygiene items to baby wipes, I thought it more prudent to help with everyday items, rather than buy, say, baby clothes. Do you think this is appropriate? I do not want to come off as cheap. The woman will be taking home more than $250 in products that are the best name-brand items. Because of the coupons, though, I only paid about $20 for it all. I also make gift baskets of full size and sample-sized matching items from the stockpile.

They need to start using their spending money to repay all the countries they have borrowed from in the past. If the spending does not stop, then the U.S. will continue to go further in to debt. With out all the useless spending, the U.S. can save some of that money to pay off the debt that has grown significantly.

"1894" "øA: You have to have a much longer-term viewpoint. First, you have to change your guidepost. Ask yourself, how much money do I need when I retire? You have to have a strong belief, if you're in good health, that you will live to probably your mid-80s. And if you're a couple who are in your 60s and in good health, statistically, one of the two of you will live to 92. So you need adequacy in your nest egg when you retire to meet those financial needs as you live longer. People today are preoccupied in trying to live a better, longer life. They may be exercising more, taking vitamins, having regular examinations. We do that because we want to live longer. We're so preoccupied with finding a lifestyle that allows us to live longer and more successfully, but we don't take that same horizon when we invest for our retirement. What I'm trying to suggest is once you start to say, I need X dollars in retirement, then you work backwards. You're not going to earn that with zero interest in cash. You're going to need some form of returns, and there are areas where you can earn 4%, 5%, 6% type of returns over a course of a long time, and that's generally shares of dividend-paying companies and other forms of credit such as high-yield and other products that will give you a higher return than cash. So if you needed, let's say, $40,000 pretax to live by or $55,000 pretax to live by, work backwards. Depending on your life, your age, how much money do you need to put away? What type of return do you need to earn to build that nest egg? And I think too few people are focusing on that."

"2467" "Hey, Tony: Last week, a reader posed a question as to whether Colt McCoy can be fairly assessed. You answered that he could, because a QB should be assessed by his individual skill-set -- \"his arm, his ability to function in the pocket, his ability to see the field and read defenses, his ability to anticipate routes and place the ball where it needs to be.\" Now, I have no idea if Colt McCoy is the answer, and frankly I do not think he is. But outside the arm element, it seems that every other aspect of your skill-set of your evaluation directly correlates to the QB's grasp of the offense. How well one knows the offense allows him to anticipate routes, helps him to know what to look for in a defense, and the inability to do either of those things results in someone looking skittish in the pocket. I believe you also said Drew Brees had a \"noodle-arm\" when he was still on the Chargers -- so, who knows? -- Sam Toth, Cleveland Heights"

The scouting combine only confirmed his standing as the top player available in the draft. He ran the 40-yard dash in 4.67 seconds - fourth among quarterbacks - and finished first in the broad jump (10 feet, 4 inches), third in the three-cone drill (6.80 seconds) and fifth in the 20-yard shuttle (4.28) at his position.

Chef/owner Michael Paulsen offers considerable compensation in the form of ingredient-dense but cunningly balanced fare, from daily flatbread pizzas piled high with goodies to memorable fish entrees in a sea of crispy/crunchy/smooth vegetables. Very good service and smoothly professional hosts (who manage to seat people efficiently and who play fair) are big pluses as well. When summer rolls in and the season renews at Ravinia (about a quarter mile away), this place is even more popular, though sidewalk tables at least boost capacity some.

Now, a three-judge panel of the appellate court has made it clear that the reasons for rejecting California's 2008 ban on same-sex marriage were not the result of one judge's personal situation but rather were based solidly on the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which contains the guarantee of equal protection of the law.

The down side is that you can make the trip all the way out to Bells and hit a day when the surf isn't up to par and the contest is off. It's a long way back to the city.

You saw them fall behind Navy and when Navy spread them out and attacked them with their quick players, Hopkins lacked a certain quickness on defense. If the Blue Jays fall behind, that does not cater to their defensive strengths.”"

Someone in Big Bit's kindergarten class had recently taught him about paper airplanes, which of course he loved (what kid doesn't?), but he still wasn't 100 percent sure about how to fold paper into an airplane shape.

Joining Kuric on the frontline are 6-6 power forward Chane Behanan and Gorgui Dieng, a 6-11 center with similar athleticism to MSUs Adreian Payne. Dieng doesnt quite have the offensive repertoire that Payne does. Louisville will have trouble matching up with Draymond Green.

"8780" "muckduck: The Ducks can now begin their dominance as an official ELITE team with that 2012 Rose Bowl win and DAT is going to be a HUGE part of this unreal offense next year!!! Samurai7: Besides the two long runs for touchdowns untouched, DAT picked up a key first down beating a defender well short of the first down marker, which set up the winning touchdown. Also, He and Barner were the \"gunners\" on the punt with 22 seconds left going downfield making the fair catch necessary and creating a long field! hermtownhomy: DAT definitely stood out, but that does not mean he should be singled out as the only reason they won. He is scary fast. Probably the fastest player in football right now and we all look forward to the future with him, but his two runs were not necessarily turning points in the game. They still could have gone on to score if those two runs hadn't happened. True turning points in the game were the interception and fumble recovery. I just don't agree with JC's point here that DAT was the reason they won. It was a team effort. RipCityDroHead85: De'Ant was prolly the MVP, I'd agree, but LaMike and Darren had pretty good games too, along with Tuinei. As far as that best duck ever, I don't know if i'd be heaping that much praise on him just yet, LaMike made a key block that sprung one of his long ones. No mention of the best duck rb ever out there blocking for another rb. portlandchiro1: I agree with the praise heaped on De'Anthony, but lets not get carried away. This was a full team win with many stars contributing. Where would Oregon have been without the two forced turnovers from the defense-including the unbelievable interception by Kiko Alonzo? How about the catches by Tunei, the grueling runs by LaMichael James, the touchdown catch by Barner, and on and on on. This was a team win and there are many heroes. Bravo to all the Ducks!!!

"8957" "The lack of consensus among Messrs. O'Malley, Miller and Busch after this morning's meeting, the trio's first face-to-face-to-face since the morning after the session adjourned in chaos, is neither surprising nor particularly dispiriting. It will take time for the ill will and recriminations that followed the session to fade, and the two legislative leaders will need to feel out their caucuses to see where they stand. After taking a beating in their districts, senators and delegates may be much more eager to come together than they were two weeks ago.

"8964" "The report cites a national study suggesting that a majority of teachers in the U.S. believe it is important to teach students to effect social change. But is that sort of politicization pervasive at UC? The report makes much of the political predilections of the faculty. Citing research from early in this decade, it points to dramatic disproportions in the ideology and party identifications of UC faculty in the humanities and social sciences. For example, it cites a 2004 study showing that Democrats in Berkeley's social sciences departments outnumbered Republicans by 21 to 1.

One \"SHUT UP!\" was all it took to get the kids to settle down and enjoy the film like they were real human beings.

"9093" "There's no way to confirm the Burtele foot is from the same evolutionary grouping as Ardi and its descendants without telltale \"diagnostic\" skull bones and teeth.

Perhaps this is why as she has gotten older she has tended to favor comic masks over tragic ones.

She can zero in on a defining vocal or physical mannerism and thus flex her muscles as a talking mime."

"9480" "Most driveway experts will back you up on at least one point – that sealing every year is excessive. Even many sealing professionals and seal-coat manufacturers agree on that point. Sealing every year can actually lead to problems, including seal-coat peeling and cracking. However, letting your driveway go unsealed for five years might also be excessive, especially if it has turned gray and is developing small cracks. There is some controversy about how often an asphalt (blacktop) driveway should be sealed, but every three years appears to strike a good balance. When an asphalt driveway turns gray, it indicates oxidation of the asphalt and weathering by sun, rain and freezing. A coat of sealer should be helpful. The small cracks are another sign that the asphalt is having problems. If the cracks are larger than hairline, fill them with top-quality crack filler before sealing. Picking good crack fillers can also be difficult. In general, avoid cheap products – they won't last more than a year or so. Most dealers sell professional-grade fillers that cost more, but will usually last a lot longer. Very tiny (hairline) cracks can be filled by the sealer; many sealers contain sand-like filler material that will close them. Before sealing, clean the driveway as thoroughly as possible. Use a blower or scraper to remove all debris and dirt. Finally, whether you seal the driveway or hire a pro, make sure a top-quality sealer is used."

We have 14,500 sailors ashore, more than the about 10,000 we have at sea. Many of those sailors ashore come from San Diego and commands around San Diego. That's about the same amount of sailors that we have committed to the fight as the Marine Corps has committed to the fight. That said, we still believe that because of our global interests, the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean/Arabian Gulf region require continued attention and continued presence and that we in the Navy are the force that best provides that presence and that attention. And we've stayed true to that even as we're dealing with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Their noodles were insanely good, followed by a great, sugar-rich dessert at the Momofuku Milk Bar (http://www.momofuku.com/restaurants/milk-bar/). I'm also a big fan of Ippudo (http://www.ippudony.com/) in the East Village, which really does have the best ramen ever. When I'm on vacation, I like to walk a lot and be surrounded by city energy. Nothing beats Manhattan for sheer kinetic excitement -- the yellow cabs, the high rises, the fast-walking people."

"13945" "In the slow-go low-range mode, all the usual strengths offered by the TRD setup - big tires, skid plating, traction control, locking differential, low range - are still strongly in play, with the extra bonus of a touch more wheel travel at each corner. TRD engineers, we're told, worked long and hard to squeeze out every millimeter of full-droop and full-compression wheel travel as possible by tuning the front and rear springs and paying close attention to the progressive bump-stops. The added articulation and strong grip of our BFGs made short work of several steep off-camber hill climbs (by our calculations, about a 30-degree slope - almost a 70-percent grade) that made our seat belt tensioners cut into our shoulder as we climbed the rutted grade to the crest."

Mr. Romney, of course, has been forced to spend heavily to fend off rival after rival, and President Obama currently has 10 times the amount of cash on hand. Still, according to Bloomberg News, that advantage slips to a less impressive two-to-one when money raised by the Romney super PAC and other independent Republican groups is taken into account. Ultimately, the total expenditures to elect Mr. Romney could match what is spent to keep Mr. Obama in the White House."

Completed in 1932, the span made from a single concrete arch stands more than 260 feet high and extends more than 700 feet across the canyon and Bixby Creek; for marathoners heading north, the bridge is a reward for the grueling two-mile climb up and rapid mile-long descent down the point. For those of us not in a rush, both the bridge and the summit of Hurricane Point, which offers sweeping prospects on non-foggy days, make obvious photo ops."

"15524" "How might you know that Canadian folk-rocker Roxanne Potvin used to be a blues singer? Perhaps you can tell by how well she’s able to make effective, compelling music from the most rudimentary materials. Many of the songs on “Play” are little more than a simple, repetitive melody sung in Potvin’s modest voice, some sandpaper guitar and a straightforward drumbeat. The French-language “Dis-Moi Que Tu M’Aimes” is little more than a shout, a swirling Farfisa riff and a few well-timed halts by the rhythm section; somehow, it’s irresistible. “Pretty Girls” repeats its title over and over like a drawled mantra — it’s more hypnotic Velvet Underground than modern pop. “Let Me Go” is little more than a blurt, but it’s certainly an arresting one. Potvin keeps things punchy by getting in and out of her songs quickly — several tracks on “Play” barely break the two-minute mark. It’s all such fun that by the time she drops her languid cover of Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy” on you at the conclusion of the album, you’ll barely mind. Fans of Liz Phair’s early insouciance and Lucinda Williams’ occasional whimsy should search this out."
